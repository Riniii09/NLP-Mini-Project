# Financial Contract Review and Classification
Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering
Project Overview:
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on Contract Review and Classification, where we apply various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to categorize financial contracts into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in classifying news articles.

Project Title:
Financial Contract Review and Classification using Natural Language Processing
Project Abstract:
Financial contracts, such as loan agreements and insurance policies, contain legally binding clauses that define obligations, risks, and benefits. Manually reviewing these contracts is a slow and error-prone process, making it difficult for financial analysts to efficiently assess compliance and risk. This project aims to automate contract section classification by categorizing clauses into high risk, standard, and beneficial.
The classification process involves text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and syntactic analysis to extract key financial and legal terms. Feature extraction methods and word embeddings help capture the semantic meaning of contract clauses. A supervised learning model trained on labeled contract data assigns categories based on contextual and linguistic patterns.
By automating contract classification, this system enhances accuracy, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistency in financial risk assessment. It provides financial analysts with a reliable tool for contract evaluation, improving decision-making and compliance monitoring in financial institutions.

Conclusion:
This project successfully automates the classification of financial contract clauses, addressing the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of manual review. By leveraging text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and supervised learning models, the system accurately categorizes clauses into high risk, standard, and beneficial. This automation not only enhances the accuracy and consistency of financial risk assessment but also reduces the manual workload for analysts. As a result, financial institutions can improve decision-making, streamline compliance monitoring, and mitigate risks more effectively. Future improvements could involve expanding the dataset, integrating advanced NLP techniques, and refining classification models for even greater precision.
